## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

3.8.1.1 What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

There is overplotting here, the values of hwy and city are rounded off. 

3.8.1.2 What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?

The "width" and "height" controls the amount of jittering.

3.8.1.3 Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

count geom  counts the number of observations at each location, then maps the count to point area. It useful when you have discrete data and overplotting.

jitter geom adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point. It is very usefull in handling the overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.

3.8.1.4 What’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualisation of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.

The default position adjustment is position_dodge()

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

Section 3.9.1
3.9.1.1. Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using coord_polar().

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = factor(1), fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
  
3.9.1.2 What does labs() do? Read the documentation.

The labs() adds labels to the graph. We can add a title, subtitle, and a label for the x and y axes, as well as a caption.

3.9.1.3 What’s the difference between coord_quickmap() and coord_map()?

The coord_quickmap does quick approximation and preserve the straight lines whereas the coord_map() DO NOT preserve the straight lines.

3.9.1.4 What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
  
4.4.1 Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable

There is a typo in variable name, the defined variable is my_variable NOT 
my_varıable

4.4.2 Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
  
filter(diamond, carat > 3) <== while working on the "mpg" data set it doesn't make sense to apply filter for diamond data set.

library(nycflights13)
view(flights)

5.2.4.1 
Find all flights that

Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
  - filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU) 
  - filter(flights, dest == "IAH" || dest == "HOU")
Were operated by United, American, or Delta
  - filter(flights, carrier == "UA" | carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL")
Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  - filter(flights, month >=7,  month <= 9)
Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
  - filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120, dep_delay <= 0)
  
Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
  -filter(flights, arr_delay >= 60, dep_delay - arr_delay>= 30)
  
Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
  -filter(flights, dep_time >=0, dep_time <= 600)

5.2.4.3 How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))

5.2.4.4 Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)

NA ^ 0 - by definition anything to the 0th power is 1.
NA | TRUE - as long as one condition is TRUE, the result is TRUE. By definition, TRUE is TRUE.
FALSE & NA - NA indicates the absence of a value, so the conditional expression ignores it.
In general any operation on a missing value becomes a missing value. Hence NA * 0 is NA. In conditional expressions, missing values are simply ignored.

5.4.1.1 Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))

5.4.1.3 What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights, one_of(vars))

It selects any variable which matches one of the strings in the vector.
